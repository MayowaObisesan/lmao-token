# Sample Hardhat Project

## LMAO AND WLMAO TOKENS

This project simulates ETH AND WETH implementations. There are two tokens deployed in this project.
A LMAO Token (LMAO, LTK) and Wrapped-LMAO Token (WLMAO, WLTK)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
